## The small project called - Ask the expert!

The Project Topic: The user becomes an expert at telling countries’ capital cities and teaches the program if it doesn’t know by running this program.

# Task: 
The input box prompts the user to enter the name of the country and when he/she writes the answer the program gives them the capital city of that country. 
If the program doesn’t know the capital city of the country, it asks the user to input the information himself/herself. The more the program is used, the smarter it gets.

# Problem:
It is tedious to find and remember the capital cities of the world's countries by looking up the map every time a person is interested in taking a glance at one of them.

# Goal:
Help the user to learn about the capital cities in a playful and less energy consuming manner.

# User Requirements:
- The program keeps working in a loop:
    - Once the program is run, the prompt asks the person to enter the name of the country
    - If the user enters the string ‘quit’ or an empty string '', the program stops.
    - While entering the country name, the program accepts values without capitalization errors.

- The program outputs the sting value that is the capital of the country

- If the program doesn’t have the information, it inquires to input the information:
    - The message: ‘I do not know the capital of this county! You can teach me so that I will be smarter next time… (Yes/No)
    - The user could either input the information about the “new” country the program does not know or escape it to continue the game.
